### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My Name is Igor - Welcome ðŸ˜œ

* * *

ðŸŽ“ i am a Administrator, Sotware Engineer student (Bachelor's degree) at Instituto Infnet and a Java Full Stack Developer.

ðŸ˜Ž i always had passion for development but only entered this world in 2022. I intend to develop new projects by myself in the next few years. Always looking to learn more and more!

âœ¨ My favourite hobbies are studying foreign languages including English (Advanced to Fluent), Japanese (Intermediate) and French (Beginner to Intermediate), playing guitar and piano, hanging out with my family and friends and also watching anime :)
