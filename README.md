### Hi there 👋 My Name is Igor - Welcome 😜

🎓 I am an Administrator and a Software Engineering student (Bachelor's degree) at Instituto Infnet, as well as a Java Full Stack Developer.

😎 I’ve always had a passion for development, but I only entered this world in 2022. I intend to develop new projects on my own in the coming years, and I’m always eager to keep learning more and more!

✨ My favorite hobbies include studying foreign languages — English (Advanced to Fluent), Japanese (Intermediate), and French (Beginner to Intermediate) — playing guitar and piano, playing chess at chess.com, spending time with my family and friends, and watching anime. :)
