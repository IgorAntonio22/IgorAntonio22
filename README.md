### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My Name is Igor - Welcome ðŸ˜œ

* * *

ðŸŽ“ I am an Administrator and a Software Engineering student (Bachelor's degree) at Instituto Infnet, as well as a Java Full Stack Developer.

ðŸ˜Ž Iâ€™ve always had a passion for development, but I only entered this world in 2022. I intend to develop new projects on my own in the coming years, and Iâ€™m always eager to keep learning more and more!

âœ¨ My favorite hobbies include studying foreign languages â€” English (Advanced to Fluent), Japanese (Intermediate), and French (Beginner to Intermediate) â€” playing guitar and piano, spending time with my family and friends, and watching anime. :)

ðŸš€ Check out my portfolio right [here]()!
